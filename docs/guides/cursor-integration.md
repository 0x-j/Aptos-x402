# Cursor IDE Integration

Enhance your development experience with AI-powered IDE integration for aptos-x402.

## Overview

Aptos x402 provides a comprehensive MDC (Model Development Context) file that enables seamless integration with AI-powered IDEs like Cursor. This integration provides intelligent code suggestions, automatic setup guidance, and best practices for implementing blockchain micropayments.

## Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Setup**: Get intelligent guidance for implementing x402 payments
- **üìù Code Examples**: Comprehensive examples for all major frameworks
- **üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices**: Built-in security and configuration guidance
- **‚ö° Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with Cursor IDE
- **üîß Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support and type hints

## Quick Setup

### 1. Copy the MDC File

Copy the aptos-x402 MDC file to your project:

```bash
# Create the .cursor/rules directory
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Copy the MDC file from the aptos-x402 repository
cp /path/to/aptos-x402/.cursor/rules/aptos-x402.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

### 2. Start Using Cursor

Once the MDC file is in place, Cursor will automatically understand how to integrate aptos-x402 into your project. You can:

- Ask Cursor to "Add x402 payment protection to my API routes"
- Request "Set up aptos-x402 middleware for Next.js"
- Get help with "Configure environment variables for aptos-x402"
