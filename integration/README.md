# Aptos x402 AI IDE Integration

This directory contains AI IDE integration files for the Aptos x402 SDK, enabling seamless integration with AI-powered development environments like Cursor.

## What is this?

The `aptos-x402.mdc` file contains comprehensive rules and examples that help AI-powered IDEs understand how to integrate the Aptos x402 payment protocol into projects. This integration provides intelligent code suggestions, automatic setup guidance, and best practices for implementing blockchain micropayments.

## How to Use

### Quick Setup:

1. **Download the MDC file** from this repository
2. **Copy it to your project**:
   ```bash
   # Create .cursor/rules directory in your project
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules
   
   # Copy the MDC file
   cp aptos-x402.mdc .cursor/rules/
   ```

3. **Restart Cursor IDE** to load the new rules

4. **Start asking Cursor for help**:
   - "Add x402 payment protection to my API routes"
   - "Set up aptos-x402 middleware for Next.js"
   - "Create a client component that pays for API calls"

### What This Enables:

- ü§ñ **AI-powered setup** - Cursor understands aptos-x402 integration
- üìù **Code generation** - Automatic code suggestions and examples
- üõ°Ô∏è **Best practices** - Built-in security and configuration guidance
- ‚ö° **Zero configuration** - Works immediately after copying the file

### For Contributors:

The MDC file should be updated whenever:
- New features are added to the SDK
- API changes are made
- New integration patterns are discovered
- Common issues are identified

## What's Included

The MDC file provides guidance for:

- **Installation** and setup
- **Environment configuration**
- **Next.js middleware** setup
- **API route protection** (zero payment logic)
- **Client integration** (axios-compatible)
- **TypeScript configuration**
- **Non-Next.js frameworks** (Express, Fastify, etc.)
- **Common issues** and troubleshooting
